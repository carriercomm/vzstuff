        deploy.sh - A Debian OpenVZ instance creator

What is this?
=============

deploy.sh is a small hack which evolved into a shellscript which aids in
deploying Debian OpenVZ instances.

It creates a new VE with an empty private area, bootstraps a Debian Lenny system,
and then sets up apt, etckeeper and nullmailer so that the new instance is
instantly useable for production.

Installation
============

Requirements:

*) A working OpenVZ Hardwarenode (only tested with Debian Lenny as HN-OS) 
*) bash
*) vzctl
*) debootstrap
*) tar
*) mktemp


Usage
=====

At first startup:

./deploy.sh setup

This creates the needed OpenVZ template and distribution files.


To create a new instance:

./deploy.sh 4711 water.cologne.de 50.56.18.6
