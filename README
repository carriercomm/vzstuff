        deploy.sh - A Debian OpenVZ instance creator

What is this?
=============

deploy.sh is a small hack which evolved into a shellscript which aids in
deploying Debian OpenVZ instances.

It creates a new VE with empty private area, bootstraps a Debian Lenny system,
and then sets up apt, etckeeper and nullmailer so that the new instance is
instantly useable for production.

Installation
============

Requirements:

*) bash
*) vzctl
*) debootstrap
