        deploy.sh - A Debian OpenVZ instance creator

What is this?
=============

deploy.sh is a small hack which evolved into a shellscript which aids in
deploying Debian OpenVZ instances.

It creates a new VE with an empty private area, bootstraps a _current_
Debian Lenny system, and then sets up apt, unattended-upgrades, etckeeper
and nullmailer so that the new instance is instantly useable for production.

Installation
============

Requirements:

*) A working OpenVZ Hardwarenode (only tested with Debian Lenny
   and Debian Squeeze as HN-OS)
*) bash
*) vzctl
*) debootstrap
*) tar
*) mktemp
*) perl


Usage
=====

At first startup:

./deploy.sh setup

This creates the needed OpenVZ template and distribution files.


To create a new instance:

./deploy.sh 4711 water.cologne.de 50.56.18.6



Updates
=======

Distribution of this software is currently done solely via git. If you have
received the software via mercurial you can update it with a simple

git pull

If you need to do a fresh checkout you can do that with

git clone git://github.com/terrorobe/vzstuff.git
